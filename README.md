# Twitter Django

Users of this simple and small social media can do the following and take advantage of these features:

• Have their own user profile with their username, picture and bio.
• View other people's user profiles and send them friend or follow requests.
• Publish posts containing relatively long texts and a number of photos with a title and category tags.
• Users should have the ability to like and dislike the contents and posts, as well as to register comments within each other.
• In addition to following people, users can also follow all the contents of a particular category sticker.
• Before logging in, users should only be able to view content or search for people with a username.
• Users should be able to archive their posts or account to remove access.
